			<p class="cursive">I work in film and paint.  The majority of my current film work is for the Canadian Opera Company.  I devised and continue to create their Inside Opera series.  This is an on-going series of films which go behind the scenes on a range of COC productions.</p>
			<p class="cursive">I also produce music videos, promotional films and news reports for various other clients throughout Toronto.</p>
			<p>As an artist, I am a painter who refuses to work with paintbrushes.  I work with the materiality of the paint first and foremost, and foreground its presence in my work. As such, my work has evolved over the years towards becoming progressively more abstract; however, it still retains its illustrative element in my preoccupation with landscapes and space.</p>
			<p>Originally from London, England, I have now settled in Toronto after almost a decade spent working and traveling around the world, with time spent in Indonesia, Russia, Australia, and Eastern Europe as well as numerous places in between. Prior to my travels, I studied Graphic Design at Southampton City College and went on to study Animation at University of Wales College, Newport, where I produced several experimental films and documentaries. After University, I worked as a freelance artist in Cardiff, London, and Manchester, producing murals, illustrations, and various other projects.</p>
			<p>My work draws inspiration from a range of sources.  The energetic melodies of Michael Nyman, built from simplistic and repetitive melodies.  The breaking down of formal cinematic structure and convention evident in the work of Michael Winterbottom and the Dogme 95 filmmaking  movement.  My films are inspired by the work of directors such as Ken Loach, Shane Meadows and Michael Winterbottom and by the cinematography of Barry Ackroyd.  My paintings derive from the intensity of emotion and colour displayed by Mark Rothko, and the strong essence of design and composition of graphic artist Stanley Donwood and designer David Carson.</p>
			<p>As a filmmaker I want to immerse the viewer in the situation and world being explored, breaking down walls, and giving my work an immediacy. I rarely use tripods and strive to capture the moment as it is in everything I do.   As a painter, I want to bring forth the energy of the paint as a material, thereby evoking the power of the image.</p>
